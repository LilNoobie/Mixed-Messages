# Tarot-Reader
Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

##About this Project
----
This project is a Portfolio project for the Codecademy Full Stack course. The goal is to showcase what I have learned so far with JavaScript, Git, Github, CLI, and Node.js.

The Tarot Reader is a simple js program you can run in your local device's console. Running the program will reveal three cards that may or may provide you some insight and enlightenment.

##How to Use
1. Download the script.js file to your local device
2. Open your console
3. Navigate to the directory and run the node

Hope you enjoy!
